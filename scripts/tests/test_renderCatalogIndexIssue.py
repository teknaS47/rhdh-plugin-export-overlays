"""Tests for renderCatalogIndexIssue.py — the catalog-index sanity failure issue (RHIDP-16694).

The workflow around this creates, deduplicates and labels the issue; none of that is
testable without GitHub. Everything with a judgement in it lives here instead: which
failures reach the body, what a report that never got written says, and — the one the
deduplication depends on — that the title does not move between runs.
